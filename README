Dietetic Ginga.ar
-----------------

This is a patched version of Ginga.ar. Currently, the main goals of this project are:

* Strip the CMake build system and replace by plain GNU makefiles.
* Strip Boost library dependency, and replace its functionality by POSIX interfaces.

If you are wondering why anyone would do this
---------------------------------------------

There is nothing wrong with CMake or Boost, they are both great, widely used tools.
However, for embedded platforms it may be of interest to tweak the building process,
changing compile and linker flags, using specific headers and/or linking to specifically 
located libraries. For this, it may be easier to use makefiles.

As for the Boost removal, it simply obeys a matter of size reduction, as Boost libraries
are not small and its funcionality can be achieved by standard Posix interfaces.
This can be compared to Busybox vs. GNU (Busybox replaces standard tools) or
ulibc vs glibc (ulibc is a reduced version of glibc aimed at embedded platforms).

In the end, this is just my own experiment. If you want to report any bugs,
place an issue on github, send me patch or a pull request.

Installation
------------

Installation needs some tweaking, so you may experience some roughness.
I'm working on it, trying to remove hardcoded crap and such. Meanwhile, if you need help, contact me.
